### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Nitroc](https://nitroc.xyz) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª, I've been a Java developper for 2 years. I'm focusing on working on Minecraft servers only.

Currently, I'm doing a bachelor's degree in management IT at IPL. With this I would like to lead to a master's degree in cybersecurity.

I'm currently working on a single project, a Minecraft PVP server that looks like a faction but isn't one ...
